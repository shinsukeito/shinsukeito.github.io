<h1>About</h1>

<p>
Hello, you have stumbled across my personal portfolio website.
<br>
<br>
My name is Shinsuke Ito. Most people call me Shin, like the lower part of the leg.
<br>
I am currently a student at <a href="https://www.rmit.edu.au/" target="_blank">RMIT University</a> studying Software Engineering.
<br>
<br>
I have built this website using <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a> and <a href="https://pages.github.com/" target="_blank">Git-Hub Pages</a> to showcase a collection of my works.
<br>
<br>
Stay awhile and look around; I hope you find some projects that spark your interest!
</p>
